                    <p>Minions is a 2015 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the spin-off/prequel[a] and the third installment overall in the Despicable Me franchise. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda (in Balda's directorial debut), written by Brian Lynch, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, the film stars the voices of Coffin as the Minions (including Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan, Jennifer Saunders, and is narrated by Geoffrey Rush.</p><br>
                    <p>Minions are small, yellow creatures who have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from yellow single-celled organisms into beings which exist only to serve history's most evil masters, but they accidentally end up killing all their masters—including a Tyrannosaurus, a caveman, a Pharaoh, and Count Dracula. They are driven into isolation after firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia and start a new life inside a cave, but after many years, the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, a minion named Kevin recruits two Minions called Stuart and Bob, setting out to look for a new master.</p>
